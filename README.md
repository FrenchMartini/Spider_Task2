1. Initialize the Project Repository:
o Create a GitHub repository for your project.
2. Build the Three Microservices:
o Develop the User service, Product service, and Cart service.
o Containerize the microservices for easy deployment later on.
o A minimal low-level logic is sufficient. Using an open-source codebase is
acceptable.
o You can use the above reference link for this part or if you want to write
your own services you are free to do so.
3. Write Dockerfiles:
o Create separate Dockerfiles for each microservice.
o Optimize each Dockerfile for a production environment.
4. Create Docker Compose Configuration:
o Define and manage the services for your E-commerce system using dockercompose.yml.
o Ensure services are correctly configured to communicate with each other.
5. Run the Multi-Container Application:
 
o Use Docker Compose to start all services with a single command (dockercompose up).
o Verify that all services are running correctly and the application is accessible.
Level 2: CI/CD Setup and Automated Deployment
1. Set Up GitHub Actions:
o Create a GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD.
o Configure the workflow to trigger on pushes to the main branch.
2. Configure Docker Build and Push:
o Add steps to the workflow to build the Docker images for each microservice.
o Push the Docker images to Docker Hub.
3. Set Up Deployment Script:
o Write a deployment script (e.g., deploy.sh) that pulls the latest Docker images and restarts the microservices using Docker Compose.
o Ensure the script handles errors gracefully and logs deployment details.
4. Write Detailed Documentation:
o Create a README.md file that includes:
▪ Instructions on how to set up the project locally. ▪ Steps to build
and run the Docker containers.
▪ Explanation of the CI/CD pipeline and how to configure it. ▪ Deployment process and any additional setup required.
